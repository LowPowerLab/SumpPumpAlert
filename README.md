SumpPumpAlert
=============

Source code for making a sump pump SMS alert system using a Moteino and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and RaspberryPi
The Gateway.py is a composite script that will read/parse messages from any other sensors and report the values to EmonCMS.
You will need to fill in your EmonCMS key, and for email alerts your GMAIL ID and password/access key.
